- [JaKooLit](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland) for providing a base template for all my hyprland config, which I later modified heavily. (I removed his watermarks btw)
- [Vineeth](https://vineeth.io/posts/neovim-setup) for providing a useful guide on starting with neovim and its configuration. (Im using only nvim now)
